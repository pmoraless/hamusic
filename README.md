<h1 align="center">Hamiltonian Music</h1>

### A project designed to analyze different types of music associated with Hamiltonian cycles and paths, and to find common trends among them.

## About the Project
Hamusic (short for Hamiltonian Music) is a collection of algorithms: data scraping, sorting, algorithm C, and algorithm D, as well as assorted utilities (data processing tools, data visualization tools, etc). Hamusic was created by, and is the intellectual property of, Annie Chu, Rajiv Perera, Anusha Karandikar and Priscila Morales. Its ultimate purpose is to analyze a set of songs to find Hamiltonian patterns and update an algorithm to visualize songs that connect well perceptually  through data analytics and computing.
